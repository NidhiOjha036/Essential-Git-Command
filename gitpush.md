# git push Command

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. 
It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches

pushing local changes to remote repository:
$ git push [--tags] [remote]


```
git push origin master/ git push -u origin master 

```
