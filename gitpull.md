# pull command

The pull command is used to access the changes (commits)from a remote repository to the local repository.
It updates the local branches with the remote-tracking branches. 
Remote tracking branches are branches that have been set up to push and pull from the remote repository.
Generally, it is a collection of the fetch and merges command. First, it fetches the changes from remote and combined them with the local repository.

The syntax of the git pull command is given below:
`git pull [remote url]`
